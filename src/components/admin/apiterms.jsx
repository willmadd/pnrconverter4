            parts of our API are undocumented, including certain methods,
            events, and properties. Given that these undocumented aspects of our
            API may change at any time, you should not rely on these behaviors.

            any of PNR Converter’s technical, administrative, process or
            security measures; that disrupts or degrades the performance of the
            PNR Converter Service or the PNR Converter API; or that tests the
